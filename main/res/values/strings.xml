    <string name="desc">In most countries, students use calculators for schoolwork. At first, this idea caused some resistance out of fear,
that basic or elementary arithmetic skills will suffer. There is still disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations in the head:
some training programs restrict the use of the calculator until a certain level of proficiency is achieved, while others
they concentrate more on teaching assessment methods and problem solving. Studies show that there is insufficient guidance on the use of computing
tools can limit students' mathematical thinking. Others claim that using a calculator can even
bring basic math skills to atrophy.</string>
